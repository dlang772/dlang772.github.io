			<p> Welcome to a peek into my life. My name is Daniel Lang. I enjoy deconstructing the science behind our thoughts and actions including why we might prefer one brand of product over another. I see an overlap between marketing and psychology, and want to use a scientific approach to creating new content. </p>
			<p>I am also passionate about usability design and realize the growing importance of having an accessible interface. In addition to designing better products, I am enthusiastic about helping improve people's lives through volunteer work at the Tufts Sharewood Clinic. Outside of class I&#39;m an avid racer for the Tufts Cycling Team, amateur rock climber, and freelance photographer. </p>
