			<p> Hi, my name is Dan. I enjoy deconstructing the science behind our thoughts and actions including why we might prefer one brand of product over another. I see an overlap between marketing and psychology, and want to use a scientific approach to creating new content. </p>
			<p>I am also passionate about usability design and realize the growing importance of having an accessible interface. Having worked in the healthcare industry and dealt with lackluster ERM software, I want to find new ways to improve the workfow for healthcare providers - then they can spend more time doing what they are good at; helping people! In addition to designing better products, I am enthusiastic about helping improve people's lives through volunteer work at the Tufts Sharewood Clinic. Outside of class I&#39;m an avid racer for the Tufts Cycling Team, amateur rock climber, and freelance photographer (click <a href="https://500px.com/dlang772" target ="_blank">here</a> to check out my photographs). </p>
